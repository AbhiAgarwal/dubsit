##About##

<p>Dubsit is a project where I try to explore some things I feel are wrong with current search methods. I believe that search through web-crawlers is not the best way to search going forward. I think that search through using APIs of different websites, and through a variety of methods would work best.</p>

<p>I was trying to implement a platform, which would allow to make social search easier. Social search is a way to search through social media, and include things like rankings, and ratings that are present and voted upon on those websites. An example would be Reddit and its upvotes. Using all these tools to create a way for a user to get the best results depending on what he searches, and give him the best socially voted upon result.</p>
